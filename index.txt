indexing is like a datastructure in the top of the db 
which allow us to do a search in the db 
using the b+ tree 


in postgresql 
explain analyze our_query 
=> will told you how much it takes 
to make this query

when we use select name from person where id ..

it will use the heap because the name doesn't exist on the index data structure
it will take us too much time to make this query

index in a ds != table in another ds 


if we specify the where condition not using the index 
ds we should analyze the full table line by line

create index person_name on person(first_name);
it will create a b-tree in the first_name column
